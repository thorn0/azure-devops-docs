# Remove or delete work items

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You can remove work items added to your backlog or taskboard that aren't relevant anymore. Simply change the State to Remove, or delete the work item. You can perform operations on individual work items or bulk modify several work items.

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/version-selector-minimize.md)]

In this article you'll learn:

You only have access to those actions that are supported on your platform and for which you have permissions. If you are a member of the Contributors group (anyone who has been added as a team member) or Project Administrators groups, you have access to the following features. For a simplified view of permissions assigned to built-in groups, see [Permissions and access](../../organizations/security/permissions-access.md).

- You must connect to a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](/azure/devops/boards/get-started/sign-up-invite-teammates).
- You must be added to a project as a member of the **Contributors** or **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, [Add users to a project or team](/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-users-team-project).
- To modify work items, you must have your **View work items in this node** and **Edit work items in this node** permissions set to **Allow**. By default, the **Contributors** group has this permission set. To learn more, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking).

> [!NOTE]  
> Users with **Stakeholder** access for a public project have full access to all work tracking features just like users with **Basic** access. For details, see [About access levels](/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels).

## Remove work items

By changing the **State** of a work item to <em>Removed</em>, you effectively remove it from a backlog or board view (product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs, Kanban board, and taskboards).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Change State to Removed](media/move-change-delete/remove-state.png)

To cause removed items to not show up in queries, you must add a clause that filters on the **State** field.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

> [!NOTE]  
> The <em>Removed</em> state isn't supported with the Basic process. It is only supported with the Agile, Scrum, and CMMI process work item types. The Basic process is available when you add a project to Azure DevOps Services or [Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2097609).

::: moniker-end

<a id="delete"> </a>

## Delete work items

Deleted work items won't appear in your backlogs, boards, or queries. Deleted items are moved to a Recycle bin from which you can recover them if needed. To delete a test case, test plan, or test suite, or other test-related work item types, see [Delete test artifacts](delete-test-artifacts.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> To permanently delete work items, you must be a member of the **Project Administrators** group or have the **Delete work items in this project** permission set to **Allow**. By default, the Contributors group has **Delete and restore work items** set to **Allow**.

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. You can delete a work item from within the work item form, by multi-selecting work items from a backlog or query results page, or from a Kanban board or taskboard.

   To delete a single work item, open the work item, choose the ![ ](../media/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon and select <strong>Delete</strong>.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] > ![work item form, actions menu, Delete](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-item.png)  
   > To delete several work items, [multi-select them from a backlog or a query results list](bulk-modify-work-items.md) and then choose the ![ ](../media/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon and select <strong>Delete</strong>.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] > ![List of work items, actions menu, Delete](media/move-change-delete/multi-delete.png)

   To delete a work item from your Kanban or taskboard, choose the ![ ](../media/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon of the card and select <strong>Delete</strong>.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Delete work item from Kanban board](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-from-kanban-board.png)

1. Confirm you want to actually delete the item(s).

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] > ![List of work items, actions menu, Delete](media/move-change-delete/multi-delete.png)

   You can also delete work items from your Kanban or taskboard.

   ![Delete work item from Kanban board](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-from-kanban-board.png)

   Or, you can drag them to the ![Recycle bin](media/recycle-bin-icon.png) (Recycle bin). You can only access the (Recycle bin) from the **Work** hub.

2. Confirm you want to actually delete the item(s).

   ![Confirm delete dialog](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-dialog-tfs.png)

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The Delete work items confirmation dialog for on-premises Azure DevOps may indicate there are auto-delete settings (disabled). There are no settings you can enable or disable. There is only a background process which permanently deletes work items that have been set to delete.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2013"

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Delete and Recycle bin** features are available from TFS 2015.2 and later versions. The Delete option isn't available for TFS 2013. You can only delete work items from the **witadmin destroywi** command.

::: moniker-end

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="= azure-devops"

You can delete a work item with the [az boards work-item delete](/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/boards/work-item#ext-azure-devops-az-boards-work-item-delete) command. To get started, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).

> [!NOTE]

                           [--org]
                           [--project]
                           [--yes]
```

#### Parameters

- **id**: Required. The ID of the work item.
- **destroy**: Optional. Permanently delete this work item.
- **org**: Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization using `az devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`. Example: `--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/`.
- **project**: Name or ID of the project. You can configure the default project using `az devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`.

The following command permanently deletes the bug with the ID 864 and doesn't prompt you for confirmation.

```CLI
az boards work-item delete --id 864 --destroy --yes
```

::: moniker-end

<a id="perm-delete"> </a>

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

Use the `witadmin destroywi` command to permanently remove work items from the data store. A permanent delete means all information in the work tracking data store is deleted and cannot be restored nor reactivated. You must be a member of the Project Administrators group of have your **Edit project-level information** permission set to Allow.

### Delete and restore actions performed under the hood

#### Delete work items

When you delete a work item, the following actions occur:

- Generates a new revision of the work item
- Updates the Changed By/Changed Date fields to support traceability
- Preserves the work item completely, including all field assignments, attachments, tags, and links
- Causes work item to become non-queryable and therefore can't appear in any work tracking experience, query result, or report
- Updates charts accordingly, CFD, velocity, burndown and lightweight charts are updated to remove deleted work items
- Removes WIT extensions
- Preserves trend data except for the latest value
- Removes the work item from the data warehouse/cube similar to as if it was permanently removed.

#### Restore work items

When you restore a work item, the following actions occur:

- Causes a new revision of the work item to be made
- Updates the Changed By/Changed Date fields to support traceability
- Becomes queryable
- All fields remain unchanged
- History contains 2 new revisions, one for deletion, and one for restore
- Reattaches WIT extensions
- Updates charts accordingly, CFD, velocity, burndown and lightweight charts are updated to include the restored work items
- Restores trend data
- Adds the work item back to the data warehouse/cube similar
- Sets the area or iteration path fields to the root node if the previous area path or iteration paths were deleted.
