This report displays the following information for each requirement that it lists:

- **Percent work completed**: Progress bar that shows the percentage of completed work based on the rollup of completed hours for all tasks that are linked to the requirement.
- **Passed tests**: The number of test cases run that have passed based on the most recent test run.
- **Failed tests**: The number of test cases run that have failed based on the most recent test run.
- **Run tests**: The number of test runs that have executed.
- **Active bugs**: The number of linked bugs in an Active state.
- **Closed bugs**: The number of linked bugs in a Closed, Done, or Completed state.

## Questions the report answers

Requirements tracking reports are useful for answering the following types of questions.

**Work progress**

- _Does the amount of work that remains for each requirement correspond to your expectations?_
- _Are top-ranked requirements being implemented first?_
- _How many tests are defined for each requirement? How many tests are passing?_
- _What requirements are being implemented that have no test cases defined for them?_

**Quality progress**

- _How many test cases have run for each requirement, and how many have passed?_
- _How many active bugs does each requirement have?_
- _Are bugs being found for requirements that are being tested?_
- _Are bugs being resolved or are they remaining active?_

**Risk assessment**

- _Which requirements are at risk?_
- _Which requirements aren't sufficiently stable for release?_
- _Which requirements can we ship today?_
