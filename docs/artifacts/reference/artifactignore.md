# Use the .artifactignore file

The `.artifactignore` is a text file that controls what files are uploaded when you publish either a [Universal Package](../quickstarts/universal-packages.md) or a Pipeline Artifact. The syntax is similar to that of `.gitignore`.

`.artifactignore` is typically checked into your version control repository in the same directory from which you upload your artifacts.

By using `.artifactignore`, you can avoid copying files into a staging directory before publishing your artifact. This can help reduce the overall pipeline execution time.

```
**/*
!src/MyApp/bin/Release/**.*
```

In the above `.artifactignore` example, we instruct the universal package task and the pipeline artifact task to ignore all files except the ones in the `src/MyApp/bin/Release` directory. To assure the proper execution, `.artifactignore` file should be checked into the root of the repository.

## Syntax

Refer to the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) for `.gitignore` syntax. `.artifactignore` follows the same syntax with some minor limitations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plus sign character `+` is not supported in URL paths as well as some of the builds semantic versioning metadata in some packages types such as Maven.

## Ignored by default

To reduce the chances of the entire `.git` folder being uploaded, we automatically ignore this directory. You can unignore/include it by adding the following to your `.artifactignore` file:

```
!.git
```
